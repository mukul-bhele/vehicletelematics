# Vehicle Telematics Analysis


## Introduction

**Vehicle Telematics Analysis** is a comprehensive exploration of telematics data, offering valuable insights into driving patterns, safety measures, and fuel efficiency. This project utilizes data collected from various sensors, including accelerometers and magnetometers, to provide a deeper understanding of driver behavior and enhance vehicle performance.

## Data Acquisition and Sensors

The core of this project revolves around data acquisition and sensor analysis. Raw data is collected from sensors like accelerometers and magnetometers, which are commonly found in modern vehicles. The data acquisition process involves thorough cleaning, processing, and conversion of raw sensor readings into meaningful and actionable information. This ensures that the data is ready for in-depth analysis.

This dataset serves as an example of the real-time data that we gather. This dataset was gathered on about 30 4-wheelers over the course of four months. While accelerometer data is gathered at 25 Hz (25 data points per second), OBD data is recorded at 1Hz frequency (one record per second).

The following columns are as follows - Device Id, timestamp, trip id, accelerometer data, speed gathered from GPS, battery voltage, coolant temperature, diagnostic trouble codes, engine load, intake air temperature, manifold absolute pressure, calculated mileage, mass airflow, engine RPM, speed collected from OBD, timing advance, throttle position and magnetometer data.

- **Sensor Types**: Utilizes accelerometers and magnetometers for data collection.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Describes data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- **Actionable Insights**: Highlights the conversion of raw sensor data into actionable insights.

## Driving Patterns Analysis

One of the primary objectives of this project is to identify and analyze driving patterns. By examining variables such as vehicle speed, RPM (Revolutions Per Minute), throttle position, and engine load over time, we gain insights into various aspects of driving behavior. This includes distinguishing between city and highway driving, detecting instances of aggressive driving, and pinpointing scenarios that promote fuel-efficient driving.

- **Relevant Variables**: Examines speed, RPM, throttle position, and engine load.
- **City vs. Highway Driving**: Distinguishes between driving patterns using speed data.
- **Visualizations**: Utilizes scatter plots to identify driving clusters.
  
## Sharp Turns Detection

Sharp turns are a critical aspect of driving behavior. To detect these, we have implemented algorithms that leverage accelerometer and gyroscope data. These algorithms are designed to identify sharp turns based on both the rapid change in the vehicle's orientation and the angle of the turn. This allows us to gain insights into how drivers navigate turns and assess the safety of their driving habits.

- **Sensor Data**: Details the use of accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Orientation Changes**: Detects sharp turns through rapid vehicle orientation changes.

## Fuel Efficiency Insights

Optimizing fuel efficiency is a crucial goal for both drivers and vehicle manufacturers. Our analysis has uncovered a strong correlation between engine load, throttle position, and fuel efficiency. To make these relationships more tangible, we've created various visualizations, including scatter plots and heatmaps. These visualizations help us understand the optimal driving practices that contribute to improved fuel efficiency.
