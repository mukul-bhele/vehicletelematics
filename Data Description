The dataset consist of the following columns:

1). Device Id: Each device is uniquely identified, and there is a one-to-one mapping between devices and cars.
2). Time Stamp: Time stamp indicates the exact time when the data was collected, provided in the format Year-Month-Day Hrs:Min:Sec.
3). Trip ID: Trip ID corresponds to a single trip, which commences when the car's engine is started and concludes when the engine is turned off.

4). accData (Accelerometer and Magnetometer Data): This data is sourced from the OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) device, representing values in terms of G-force       
                                                   It encompasses measurements across the X, Y, and Z axes, where the X-axis is horizontal, the Y-axis is 
                                                   vertical, and the Z-axis denotes the car's movement direction.

5). gps_speed: This parameter signifies the vehicle's speed in kilometers per hour, determined via the GPS sensor.
6). battery: Battery voltage corresponds to the voltage level of the car's battery, which supplies electrical energy to the vehicle.

7). cTemp (Coolant Temperature): This value denotes the temperature of the engine coolant in an internal combustion engine.
                             The typical operational temperature range for most engines is between 90 to 104 degrees Celsius (195 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit).

8). dtc (Diagnostic Trouble Codes): It indicates the number of diagnostic trouble codes detected. These codes are used by automobile manufacturers
                                to diagnose issues related to the vehicle.

9). eLoad (Engine Load): Engine load quantifies the volume of air (and fuel) drawn into the engine, comparing it to the theoretical maximum.

10). iat (Intake Air Temperature): The Intake Air Temperature sensor (IAT) serves as an input signal for the Engine Control Unit (ECU) to calculate
                              air mass volume for incoming air. This aids in determining the engine's fuel requirements to suit the prevailing air temperature.

11). imap (Manifold Absolute Pressure): The manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP sensor) is employed in an internal combustion engine's electronic control system.
                                   It provides real-time data on manifold pressure to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU), which is crucial for
                                   calculating air density, determining the engine's air mass flow rate, and influencing ignition timing.

12). kpl (Kilometres per Litre): KMPL is a metric denoting mileage in kilometers per liter. It is derived from speed and the ratio of fuel to air mass flow.
                            While this ratio remains constant for petrol cars, it may vary for other fuel types, potentially introducing some error in
                            KMPL calculations.

13). maf (Mass Air Flow): A mass (air) flow sensor (MAF) is utilized to ascertain the mass flow rate of air entering a fuel-injected internal combustion engine.
                     This data is essential for the engine control unit (ECU) to accurately regulate and deliver the required fuel mass to the engine.

14). rpm (Revolutions Per Minute): RPM here refers to engine RPM, indicating how many revolutions the engine's crankshaft makes in one minute.
15). speed: Speed data is collected from the OBD device mounted in the car.
16). tAdv (Timing Advance): Timing advance denotes the number of degrees, measured before top dead center (BTDC), at which the spark will ignite the air-fuel
                       mixture in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke.

17). tPos (Throttle Position): Throttle position signifies the degree to which the throttle is open, indicating the driver's desired level of power or speed.
